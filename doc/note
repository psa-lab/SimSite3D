You should now populate your master file ./index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
   where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.


run sphinx-build -b html <sourcedir> <builddir>

run sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
