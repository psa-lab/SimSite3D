gen_sitemap takes either 2 or 3 parameters.  The first parameter is the path to
the protein file (in pdb format).  The second parameter is the path to the 
ligand file (in mol2 format).  The optional third parameter can be used to
specify the name of the generated sitemap file.  If the third parameter is
specified, the sitemap file is stored relative to your current working
directory.  If the third parameter is not specified, the sitemap file is
stored in the current directory .

Note:  You may specify proteins and ligands files that are in the directories
$ASCBASE_DBASE_PROTS and $ASCBASE_DBASE_LIGS respectively by just giving their 
name (e.g. 1eqm_atp_p.pdb).

These examples directories correspond to an example of creating a site map for 
the ATP binding site in the pdb structure 1eqm:

The command to generate the ATP sitemap for 1eqm (from this directory) is:  
	"gen_points -p in/1eqm_ADP_p.pdb -l in/1eqm_ADP_l.mol2 --msms_surf 1eqm_ADP_s.csv".

To verify the results, you my use the command:
	"diff 1eqm_ADP_s.csv out/1eqm_ADP_s.csv"
	"diff 1eqm_ADP_s.pdb out/1eqm_ADP_s.pdb"
	"diff 1eqm_ADP_a.pdb out/1eqm_ADP_a.pdb"
to check if there are any differences between your sitemap, for the 1eqm
ATP site, and the one provided in the out directory.
