# WARNING!:  These hbond data files are highly structured--do not edit them.
# If you insist you are doing so at your own risk.
# 
# Empty lines -- those which have only the '\n' character are used to
# change sections.  The format of the lines is as follows:
# The residues with these atom types |
# The element name of the atom |
# 1 -- atom is a donor, 2 -- atom is an acceptor, 3 atom is a doneptor |
# The "in-plane" angle |
# The "out-of-plane" angle |
#
# Note:  This method has one caveat, the sidechain atoms are all determined
# by residue name and element type except for arginine.  In the case of 
# arginine we need to check if the N is the epsilon nitrogen or not.  If an 
# atom is the arginine epsilon nitrogen, we use the WR set of angles, and 
# the other 2 Ns of the guanadinium group are specified by the NQR set.
#
# This is getting messy.  At the present the 3rd field is not used by 
# SimSite3D, and should NOT be used for His residues.
# The reason is NE2 has been changed to favor protonation over an unknown state # --  Discussion with Leslie and Matt based on 
# Jack Kyteâ€™s Structure in Protein Chemistry pKa diagram for the 
# high-probability states of His around pH 7
