# 1) residues
# 2) element
# 3) The "object" -- LP is lone pair, H is proton and U is either LP or proton 
# 4) The number of the "object" -- as in first, second or third
# 5) the "in-plane" angle (in degrees)
# 6) the "out-of-plane" angle (in degrees)
#
# This is getting messy.  At the present the 3rd field is not used by 
# SimSite3D, and should NOT be used for His residues.
# The reason is NE2 has been changed to favor protonation over an unknown state # --  Discussion with Leslie and Matt based on 
# Jack Kyteâ€™s Structure in Protein Chemistry pKa diagram for the 
# high-probability states of His around pH 7
