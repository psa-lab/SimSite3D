search_sitemaps can be run in one of two modes:
	1) Compare two sitemaps.
	2) Blast one sitemap against a directory of sitemaps.

(1) To compare two sitemaps you can invoke search_sitemaps by listing
the names of the two sitemaps.
(2) To compare one (query) sitemap against a database (directory) of sitemaps 
you need to list only the query sitemap as a argument to search_sitemaps.

In this example, we compare the ATP sites of the pdb crystal structures
1eqm and 1b38.  To run the comparision, type:
	"search_sitemaps in/1b38_atp_s.csv in/1ua2_atp_s.csv"
When finshed (typically a few minutes), you can find the output in the directory
$PROJ_OUTPUT/1b38_atp_results.  An example output directory and an example
DrugScore 1.2 score file may be found in the out directory.  (Note:  because 
two "full" binding sites were compared, the ligand and ligand fragment files in 
the directories 1b38_atp/moved_ligands and 1b38_atp/ligand_fragments 
respectively are the same).

DrugScore:  DrugScore 1.2 writes out 3 files for each comparison (scoring). 
A log file, an info file and a score file.  Because 3 files are written for
each site in a search, a large number of files are generated.  For this reason,
the default action of ASCbase is to read the score from the DrugScore score 
file and delete the DrugScore files.

SFCscore:  Please refer the Quick Guide for information on how to setup the 
interface to SFCscore (because of the large number of options to SFCscore
the methods to setup the interface are not discussed here).

Molecular Graphics:  You may visualize the ligand "hit" by along with its 
reference by viewing the protein, reference ligand and hit ligand 
(in/1b38_atp_p.pdb, in/1b38_atp_l.mol2, 
$PROJ_OUTPUT/1b38_atp_results/ligand_fragments/1ua2_atp_0001_ASCbase_frag_l.mol2
respectively).
